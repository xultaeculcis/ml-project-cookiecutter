Project structure and tool usage is highly opinionated within this project. As the times change, so do the best
practices. I will try to keep the project up to date with the latest tools and practices.

The goal of this project is to make it easier to start, structure, reproduce, maintain and later deploy
an ML project. The stuff in it is based on my own experiences and might not suit your needs. If you think something
should be done differently, feel free to create an issue or fork the repo for your own usage. It's an MIT license,
so you can do whatever the hell you want with it.

Creating pull requests and filing issues is welcome. I'd love to hear what works for you and what does not.
Although I cannot promise to not close them if I disagree with you.
